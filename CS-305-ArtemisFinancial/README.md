## ðŸ“– Project Overview
Worked with Artemis Financial, a financial consulting company, to modernize operations and protect sensitive client data. The project focused on identifying vulnerabilities, implementing encryption, and securing communications.

## ðŸ›  What I Did
- Conducted a **vulnerability assessment** and identified false positives.  
- Refactored code to implement **SHA-256 encryption** for secure data handling.  
- Replaced HTTP with **HTTPS** using a self-signed certificate.  
- Delivered a concise report with vulnerabilities found and mitigation strategies.  
- Used **Maven dependency checker** to ensure up-to-date and secure builds.  

## ðŸ’¡ Key Skills Demonstrated
- Secure Coding Practices  
- Encryption (SHA-256) & HTTPS Implementation  
- Vulnerability Assessment & Mitigation  
- Dependency Management with Maven  
- Technical Documentation & Reporting  

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `src/` â€“ Refactored secure code implementations.  
- `docs/` â€“ Vulnerability reports and supporting documentation.
