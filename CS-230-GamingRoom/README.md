# ðŸŽ® CS-230: Gaming Room App

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project was developed for *The Gaming Room*, a client that wanted to expand their Android-based game **Draw It or Lose It** into a scalable, cross-platform web application. The goal was to design a system that could handle unique game/team/player instances, maintain performance, and prioritize user experience and security.

---

## ðŸ›  What I Did
- Designed and documented the system architecture, including UML diagrams and requirements analysis.  
- Implemented core features with **design patterns**:  
  - **Singleton** â€“ ensures only one instance of the game service exists in memory.  
  - **Iterator** â€“ enforces uniqueness of game, team, and player names.  
- Created a secure, efficient system structure that emphasized user-friendly error handling and constraints.  
- Recommended **Windows as the primary platform** for user familiarity and performance, while ensuring cross-platform capability through a web-based architecture.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Skills Demonstrated
- Software Engineering & Documentation  
- Design Patterns (Singleton, Iterator)  
- UML Diagrams & Requirements Analysis  
- User-Centered and Secure Design Principles  
- Maven Project Structure & Config Management
