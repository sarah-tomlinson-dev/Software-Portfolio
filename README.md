# 💻 Software Portfolio – Sarah Tomlinson

Welcome! This repository is a curated portfolio of projects from my Computer Science coursework and certifications. Each project demonstrates different aspects of **software development, data structures, security, and data analysis** — highlighting both my technical skills and problem-solving approach.

I hold a **B.S. in Mathematics**, I’m completing a **B.S. in Computer Science**, and I recently earned a certification in **Data Science with Python**. My career focus is on **data analytics, data science, and software development**.
