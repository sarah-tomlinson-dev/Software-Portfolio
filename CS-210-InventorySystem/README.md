# ðŸ“¦ CS-210: Inventory System

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project was developed as part of CS-210 *Programming Languages* and focuses on building an **Inventory Management System** in C++.  
The program reads product data from external files, processes inventory transactions, and outputs frequency and usage statistics in a clean, user-friendly format.  

The project emphasizes **modularity** (separating logic across multiple files), **file I/O operations**, and applying fundamental **object-oriented programming** principles.

---

## ðŸ›  What I Did
- Designed and implemented a modular C++ program split across multiple source/header files.
- Integrated **file input/output** to read product lists and frequency data for inventory tracking.
- Created robust functions for:
  - Displaying product frequency reports.  
  - Managing inventory records.  
  - Providing a user-friendly console interface.  
- Documented the program design, implementation, and testing process in a comprehensive report.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Skills Demonstrated
- C++ Programming (OOP, modular design, header files).  
- File Input/Output (text and data file handling).  
- Data validation and structured error handling.  
- Software design documentation and testing practices.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- [`src/Main.cpp`](src/Main.cpp) â€“ Main program entry point.  
- [`src/Products.cpp`](src/Products.cpp) â€“ Inventory logic implementation.  
- [`src/Products.h`](src/Products.h) â€“ Header file for inventory class definitions.  
- [`data/ProductList.txt`](data/ProductList.txt) â€“ Input file containing available products.  
- [`data/frequency.dat`](data/frequency.dat) â€“ Frequency data output file.  
- [`docs/CS-210-Project_Documentation.pdf`](docs/CS-210-Project_Documentation.pdf) â€“ Project documentation detailing design decisions and testing.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Compile the program:  
   ```bash
   g++ src/Main.cpp src/Products.cpp -o InventorySystem

2. Run the executable:   
./InventorySystem

3. The program will read from ProductList.txt and generate frequency data into frequency.dat.
