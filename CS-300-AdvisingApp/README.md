# CS-230: Gaming Room App

## 📖 Project Overview
Designed a web-based game system for “Draw It or Lose It,” adapted from the classic TV show *Win, Lose or Draw*. The client requested a scalable system to expand beyond Android into a cross-platform web application.

## 🛠 What I Did
- Applied **Singleton pattern** to ensure a single instance of the game service.  
- Used **Iterator pattern** to enforce unique team, game, and player names.  
- Produced detailed documentation including UML diagrams and client requirements.  
- Prioritized user needs with platform recommendations, performance optimization, and security features.  

## 💡 Key Skills Demonstrated
- Software Engineering & Documentation  
- Design Patterns (Singleton, Iterator)  
- UML Diagrams & Client Requirements Translation  
- User-Centered Design & Security Awareness
