# CS-300: Advising App

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
Built an advising tool for the Computer Science department at ABCU. The program loads a list of courses and their prerequisites from a file, then allows users to view the entire catalog or look up the prerequisites of a specific course.

## ðŸ›  What I Did
- Implemented core functionality using **Binary Search Trees (BSTs)** for fast prerequisite lookups.
- Compared efficiency across different data structures (vectors, hash maps, BST).
- Wrote pseudocode before development to plan logic and improve implementation flow.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data Structures & Algorithms (BST, Hash Maps, Vectors)  
- Efficient searching and scalability  
- Pseudocode and modular programming  
- Code readability and maintainability  

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `src/` â€“ Source code implementing prerequisite search functionality.  
- `docs/` â€“ Pseudocode and supporting design notes.
