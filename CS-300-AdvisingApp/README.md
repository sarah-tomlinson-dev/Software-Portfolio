# ðŸ“š CS-300: Advising App â€“ Course Planning System

## ðŸ“– Project Overview
This project was developed for the **Computer Science department at ABCU** to support academic advising.  
The application loads courses and their prerequisites from a CSV input file, then allows users to:

- Print the full list of courses in **alphanumeric order**  
- Search for a **specific course** and view its prerequisites  
- Exit the program  

The goal was to design an efficient advising tool by comparing multiple data structures and implementing the best choice for performance and scalability.

## ðŸ›  Implementation Details
- Explored and compared:  
  - **Vector** (sequential storage)  
  - **Hash Table** (fast lookups, no ordering)  
  - **Binary Search Tree (BST)** (efficient lookups + ordered output)  
- Final implementation uses a **Binary Search Tree (BST)** for scalability and ordered traversal.  
- Developed pseudocode and runtime analysis before writing the implementation.  
- Program written in **C++**, emphasizing modularity, readability, and error handling.
